## Eurovision Song Contest Review System

Welcome to our Eurovision Song Contest review system, where we celebrate our love of music and family bonding. This project aims to create a web-based platform using Python and FastAPI, powered by Jinja2 templates, to collect and display reviews of the participating songs.

The idea is simple: as we watch the contest together, we'll score each song in three categories - Wardrobe (how much do we like the artist's style?), Melody
(how catchy and memorable is the tune?), and Show (how engaging is the performance?). Our goal is to have a fun and interactive way to discuss and compare our opinions on the songs.

In this project, you'll find the code for the web application that allows us to input our scores and display them in a user-friendly format. We hope this becomes an enjoyable tradition for many years to come!

**UNDER DEVELOPMENT - SUBJECT TO CHANGE**

This project is currently under active development, which means that the codebase, documentation, and installation instructions are subject to change at any time without notice. As such, the following installation instructions may already be obsolete or incomplete.

## Get started by:
1. Cloning the repository
2. Installing dependencies (listed in `requirements.txt`)
3. Running the FastAPI app using `uvicorn`
4. Reviewing the songs and sharing your thoughts!

Have fun, and let's make this a memorable Eurovision experience!
